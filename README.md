# SSDDP - 2015-group1 #

This is a school project, where the task was to design a simple discovery protocol and implement a prototype.
The prototype should be able to simulate 10+ nodes that communicate with each other through the designed protocol.
To be able to create automated simulation runs with several prototype nodes, a small testing framework was created
and is included in the project. Because this was a school project with a time limit, the application structure is still a bit messy
and should be reorganized if development is continued.
